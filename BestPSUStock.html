    <p class="intro">
      Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) are government-owned companies that operate across critical sectors like oil, energy, defense, banking, and infrastructure. Many of these firms are highly profitable, dividend-paying, and play a key role in India’s economy. PSU stocks have become attractive again due to strong earnings, privatization plans, and stable growth outlook.
